# Windows Direct2D Development with Rust

## Introduction

Welcome to *Windows Direct2D development with Rust*, an introductory book about developing [Direct2D](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct2d/direct2d-portal) applications with Windows and the [window-rs](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs) crate. 

Rust has many advantages over other languages available for Windows development and is particularly well suited to developing performant, safe, and reliable Direct2D applications. 

The [window-rs](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs) crate makes Windows APIs available to Rust developers. With the windows-rs you can now develop fully featured Windows applications that take advantage of the capabilities provided by Direct2D.

## Who should read this book?

This book is for anyone that wants to start developing Direct2D applications with the window-rs crate and Direct2D. It does not require extensive prior experience with Win32 development or Rust although an understanding of Win32 development will help you understand the concepts presented. 

## How this book is organized
The book is in 2 parts. Part I is an introduction to various aspects of Direct2D and Win32 API; basic drawing, DirectWrite, and animation.

Part 2 combines all of the concepts in part 1 into a fully functioning Direct2D implementation of the Windows classic Minesweeper game.

This book assumes that you have a basic understanding of Rust. If this is not the case, we recommend [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/). For a more in depth understanding of Rust, we recommend [Rust for Rustaceans](https://rust-for-rustaceans.com/)
