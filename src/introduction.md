# Windows Direct2D Development with Rust

## Introduction

## Who should read this book?

This book is for anyone that wants to start developing Direct2D applications with the window-rs crate and Direct2D. It does not require extensive prior experience with Win32 development or Rust although a basic understanding of Win32 development will help you understand the concepts presented. 

This book assumes that you have a basic understanding of Rust. If this is not the case, we recommend [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/). For a more in depth understanding of Rust, we recommend [Rust for Rustaceans](https://rust-for-rustaceans.com/)
